# Jpotify
Jpotify is a music palyer similar to Spotify.

We have implemented all the properties of the Spotify music player (including its graphics) plus a sharelist.
You can add your friends to your contacts and have share list with them. 
If you add a song into the share list, they will be able to download it drectly from the music player.
And respectively, if they add a song into their share list, you can download it directly from the music player.

The project is implemented solely by Jave.

You can see the music player by just simply running the code. :)
